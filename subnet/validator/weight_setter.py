"""Background thread for periodic weight updates.

Builds a deterministic top-50% race-finisher weight vector via
`weight_distribution.build_metagraph_weight_vector` and submits it to the
chain. Determinism across validators is load-bearing for Yuma consensus on
subnet 15 (`kappa = 0.5`).

When no completed race is available (fresh subnet, race-system rollback,
backend outage) the tick is skipped — weight setting waits for the next
tick rather than submitting a stale or non-race vector.

    A "finisher" is a qualifier with a non-null `race_score` — i.e.
    the agent ran the race to completion and got scored. Qualifiers
    with `race_score=null` (DNF, eliminated mid-race, never executed)
    are intentionally dropped: they did not finish the race, so they
    are not protected from deregistration by this mechanism. A
    `race_score=0.0` finisher is still a finisher (they completed but
    scored zero) and competes for a top-half slot like everyone else;
    the linear taper naturally drops them out of the protected set
    when other finishers outscore them.

    Also drops entries without a `miner_hotkey` defensively so a
    partial-data Backend response can't poison the ranking.

    Discarded agents (admin- or auto-discarded, surfaced via
    `is_discarded` on the SDK record) are dropped so they stop earning
    emissions via the rank-1 fallback or the protected tail set.
